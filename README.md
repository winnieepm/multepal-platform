# a nuxt.js x sci-fi experiment

Used Nuxt.js to build a webpage for Prof. Njelle Hamilton's class. The page is one component of my final project. It holds a collection of sketches that are in turn part of an effort to visually outline the structure of time in _Caja de fractales_ (2017), a sci-fi novel by the Puerto Rican author Luis Othoniel Rosa.
